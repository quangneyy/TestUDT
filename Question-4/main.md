User -> AuthenticationServer: Log in
AuthenticationServer -> User: Verify credentials
User -> AuthenticationServer: Request access token
AuthenticationServer -> AuthorizationServer: Validate token request
AuthorizationServer -> AuthenticationServer: Issue access token
AuthenticationServer -> User: Send access token

User -> ResourceServer: Request resource
ResourceServer -> AuthorizationServer: Validate access token
AuthorizationServer -> ResourceServer: Authorize access token
ResourceServer --> User: Return requested resource

User -> AuthenticationServer: Log out
AuthenticationServer -> User: Invalidate token

* Strong:
_ Security: The solution employs token-based authentication and authorization, which is a secure method for controlling access to resources.
_ Scalability: LoopBack4 provides a modular and scalable architecture, allowing for easy extension and adaptation to handle increased API endpoints.
_ Flexibility: LoopBack4's architecture allows for easy customization of authentication and authorization logic to fit specific requirements.

* Weaknesses:
_ Complexity: Setting up authentication and authorization in LoopBack4 can be complex, especially for beginners.
_ Maintenance: Managing access control rules and ensuring they remain consistent across a growing number of API endpoints can become challenging.
_ Performance: Depending on the implementation, there might be performance overhead associated with validating tokens and enforcing access control rules.

* Improvements:
_ Simplified Configuration: Streamline the configuration process for authentication and authorization to reduce complexity.
_ Centralized Access Control: Implement a centralized access control mechanism to manage permissions more effectively.
_ Caching: Introduce caching mechanisms to improve the performance of token validation and access control checks.
_ Logging and Monitoring: Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities to track authentication and authorization events for better security and troubleshooting.

* Testing and Scalability:
To ensure correct permissions scalability from 100 APIs to 1000 APIs:

_ Unit Testing: Write comprehensive unit tests for authentication and authorization logic to verify individual components' functionality.
_ Integration Testing: Perform integration tests to ensure seamless interaction between different modules and components.
_ Scalability Testing: Test the system's scalability by gradually increasing the number of API endpoints and verifying that authentication and authorization mechanisms can handle the load effectively.
_ Load Testing: Conduct load tests to evaluate the system's performance under varying loads, ensuring it can handle increased API endpoints without compromising performance.
